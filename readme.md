#New Arduino Capacitance Meter

This code is just an _edit_ of some code from a tutorial on the [Arduino website](http://arduino.cc") called [CapacitanceMeter](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/CapacitanceMeter) for the ```LiquidCrystal``` library. It really isn't that much.

I came to release this code due to high demand:

To all the poeple that waited forever for this code (i stalled the release for about 2 years): **I'm truly sorry ;(**
