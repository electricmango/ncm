This code is just an _edit_ for the ```LiquidCrystal``` library. It isn't that much.

I came to release this code due to high demand.

To all the poeple that waited forever for this code: **I'm truly sorry ;(**

For a detailed schematic and original code (which uses the serial port): <http://arduino.cc/it/Tutorial/CapacitanceMeter>

Thanks for waiting.
